# RandomForestWaterPumps
Random Forest Classification on Water Pump Dataset from Tanzanian Ministry of Water
Dataset and problem: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/ 

- Started as a pair data science project at university. The other group member [@pointonjoel](https://github.com/pointonjoel) implemented a logistic regression model on the same dataset whilst I implemented a random forest model.

- Highest score achieved is 80.21% based on the classification rate (the percentage of rows where the predicted class y^ in the submission matches the actual class, y in the test set). 
 
- The file containing the code for the Random Forest Classification is rfCLASSIFIER.ipynb
