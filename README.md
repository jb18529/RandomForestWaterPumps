# RandomForestWaterPumps
Random Forest Classification on Water Pump Dataset from Tanzanian Ministry of Water
Dataset and problem: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/ 

- Started as a group project of 2 at university.

- Highest score achieved is 80.21% based on the classification rate (the percentage of rows where the predicted class y^ in the submission matches the actual class, y in the test set). Currently working on improving this score and implementing a neural network approach to this problem.
 
- The file containing the code for the Random Forest Classification is rfCLASSIFIER.ipynb
